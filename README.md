# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of personal concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies.

This is a personal reference, so it is written in a way I understand.

Besides [Fixing submissions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome, I maintain thispersonal. If you want to contribute to an collective TIL I recommend you to take a look at [til-collective](https://github.com/til-collective/til-collective) from Josh Branchaud.

_4 TILs and counting..._
